# Rust Learning

This repository contains programs that I have made in the process of learning the
Rust programming language. Many of the programs here are from the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/) (2018 edition),
while others are simply toy programs I wanted to make. :smiley:

## Directory Structure

This repository contains a series of subdirectories which all contain a Cargo project.
To build a specific binary, `cd` into the respective binary and `cargo build` the project.
