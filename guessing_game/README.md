# Guessing Game (aka Hi-Lo game)

In this game, the program generates a random number between 1 and 100 inclusive
which the user has to guess. If the user's entered number is higher or lower than
this secret number, then the program will output the respective statement and prompt
the user again for input. If the number guessed is correct, the user has won the game.
At its end, the program will output the number of attempts it took the user in determining
the correct number.
